Introduction

Recipe Use

Recipes were chosen for this laboratory manual to illustrate principles of food preparation. While most of the recipes produce a standard product, some are not designed for general use. For example, while all the recipes in the food preservation section will result in food that is safe, some variations will not be of standard quality. Other recipes are formulated for a specific purpose, such as the recipes for cream pie fillings that are designed to set within a three-hour laboratory period and may be too stiff if allowed to stand longer. In some cases, the ingredient proportions are dependent upon the size of the recipe and results will not be satisfactory if the recipe is increased.

Ingredients

Margarine may be substituted for butter in all recipes unless the recipe specifies otherwise.

Bottled lemon juice may be used in all recipes unless a recipe specifies fresh or frozen juice.

Temperatures and Measurements

Most recipes in this manual are designed for common household utensils and appliances. Because of that, most measurements are common household measurements. The Celsius scale is used for all temperatures except oven temperatures, which are in Fahrenheit.

In order to convert temperature from one scale to another, use the following:

ºC = (ºF-32) / 1.8

ºF = (ºC x 1.8) + 32

Equivalents

Equivalents with abbreviations used in the laboratory manual:

There are 4 quarts in a gallon, two pints in a quart, and 2 cups in a pint. 1 gallon = 4 quarts (qt.)

1 quart = 2 pints (pt.)

1 pint = 2 cups

1 cup = 8 fluid ounces (oz.) or 16 tablespoons (tbsp.)

1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons (tsp.)

1 pound (lb.) = 454 grams (g.) or 16 ounces

1 large egg = ~¼ cup = 4 tbsp.

dash – few grains, less than 1/16 tsp.

Some products must be packed or weighed to attain the correct measurement.

1 cup grated cheese = 4 oz. = 114 g.

How to use: 3 teaspoons equal a tablespoon, 6 teaspoons equal one ounce, 48 teaspoons equals a cup, ect.

1.3 Sensory Attributes Activity

How to Describe the Sensory Attributes of Foods

As a part of this lab activity you will be asked to describe the attributes of a food product accurately and completely. The task is to describe the food, not your reaction to the food. For

example, a chocolate pudding might be medium brown, smooth and shiny, thick but not gelled and have a flavor that includes sweet, chocolate and vanilla components. To make these kinds of descriptions, you will need to learn to go past your first reaction (I like it! Or I don’t like it!) and notice specific details about the food itself.

We usually notice the attributes of foods in the following order:

Appearance

Odor/Aroma

Consistency and Texture

Flavor

When we eat food, we often do not try to separate these sensations, we naturally just form an overall opinion about how much we like or dislike the product based on all of its attributes. With practice, however, we can learn to be more analytical about identifying and describing the sensory attributes of foods. To best describe the sensory attributes of foods, try the following approach:

1. Appearance: Look at the food and describe all of the following that apply (not all of the

attributes listed will apply to every food, and for some foods, you will need to come up with

additional terms).

Color description:

Is it red, orange, brown, yellow-green, etc.?

The intensity of color: Is it light, medium, or dark?

Brightness: Is it bright or dull?

Evenness of color: Is the color even or is it uneven or blotchy?

Size and shape of the pieces or particles:

Are the pieces or particles relatively small, medium, or large? Square, round, flat, etc?

Evenness of distribution: Are the particles within the food uniformly or non- uniformly distributed?

Surface texture:

Is it dull or shiny; smooth or rough, grainy, curdled or bumpy; plump or shriveled:

Does it look wet or dry, soft or hard; if made up of particles, are they loose or

clumped?

Clarity:

Is it clear or hazy or cloudy, transparent, translucent or opaque? Are particles or

bubbles evident?

2. Odor or Aroma: Sniff the food a few times to detect the odor or aroma. The odor is caused by volatiles that reaches the olfactory receptors high up in the nasal cavity. There are thousands of possible descriptors for food aromas. Sometimes we call the specific aromas “notes.” For example, a cookie might have a toasted wheat note or a caramelized note, a buttery note, and a vanilla note.

3. Consistency and Texture: When we manipulate food with our hands or with utensils and when we bite and chew it, we can judge how the food reacts to stress. As you sample your product, see if the following apply (you may need other terms as well).

Is the product thin or thick?

Is it soft, firm, or hard?

Is it airy or is it dense or heavy?

Is the product springy or rubbery?

Is the product slippery or slimy?

Is the product sticky?

Is the product brittle? crumbly?

When we eat food, we can also perceive the size and shape of particles in food through our sense of touch. And we can also note aspects that relate to the release of fat and moisture. Does your product have some of the following attributes?

Smoothness (absence of particles)

Grittiness (has small, hard particles)

Graininess (has small particles)

Chalkiness (imparts a film of fine particles or is powdery)

Flakiness (breaks into flat overlapping layers)

Fibrousness (has long, stringy particles)

Lumpiness (has large, even particles)

Juiciness (releases moisture as you chew; feels wet in your mouth)

Oiliness (leaves an oily residue in your mouth)

Greasiness (leaves a more solid greasy residue in your mouth)

4. Flavor: Flavor is the impression that we get from the chemicals in the food that are released when we are eating. Flavor consists of 1) tastes, 2) aromatics and 3) other sensations due to the stimulation of nerves in our mouth and nasal cavity.

Tastes are caused by water soluble materials that reach the taste receptors on our tongue and on other surfaces in the mouth. Tastes are limited in number and include

Sweet

Sour

Salty

Bitter

Aromatics include notes like lemon, butter, rancid, burnt, cheesy, cinnamon, meaty and thousands more such sensations. When we chew a product it seems like these flavor

notes are coming from our mouth, but the volatile molecules being released from the food actually travel to the olfactory receptors when air is forced up and over these receptors as

we chew. The aromatics are responsible for much of the flavor impact for most foods.

Chemical Feeling Factors: Some chemicals in foods cause sensations that are not taste or smell but are important to flavor in some foods. These include:

Astringency (a sensation of dryness or puckering in the mouth)

Heat (from spices)

Cooling (from menthol)

Biting (for example from highly carbonated beverages)

Pungency (for example from horseradish)

Try to name all of the tastes, flavor aromatics and chemical feeling factors that you can identify

in your product.

5. Noise: Some foods make noise when we eat them. These noises contribute to perceptions such as

Crispiness

Crunchiness

Squeakiness

Did your product have any of these attributes?

2.7 Methods of Preparation

Objectives

To practice various cooking methods for fresh and frozen vegetables – boiling, broiling, baking, steaming, panning, sautéing, etc.

To prepare less-familiar vegetables in order to appreciate the wide variety of characteristics of vegetables.

Laboratory Problems

Prepare vegetables according to the following recipes.

Buttered crumbs: Blend ¼ cup fine dry bread crumbs with 1 tbsp. melted butter.

Culinary Techniques

Blanch or parboil – Partially cook in a large amount of boiling water to inactivate enzymes or to facilitate peeling.

Pan (verb) – Cook very thin slices of vegetables at high heat in enough oil to keep them from sticking. Vegetables may be covered and a very small amount of water (1-2 tbsp.) added to create steam. When covered, the pan should be shaken to prevent sticking.

Sauté – Cook in a small amount of fat over fairly high heat in an open, shallow pan until just done; vegetables should look translucent, not brown.

Stir-fry – Heat a small amount of oil. Add very thin slices of vegetables and cook over medium-high heat. Stir constantly. A wok is the preferred utensil, but a large, deep skillet may be used. Cook only a few vegetables at a time.

Return the apple pulp to the saucepan and add enough reserved liquid for desired thickness; add enough sugar (1/4 to 1/2 cup) to sweeten. Heat, stirring constantly, to dissolve sugar. Fill jars with hot sauce, leaving ½ inch headspace. Process immediately in boiling water bath for 20 minutes.

Tomato and Chili Salsa

2½ lbs. tomatoes ½ cup vinegar (5% acetic acid)

½ lb. green bell peppers 1½ tsp. salt

½ lb. chili peppers ¼ tsp. pepper

½ lb. onions

Caution: Wear plastic or rubber gloves and do not touch your face while handling or cutting hot peppers. If you do not wear gloves, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before touching your face or eyes.

Prepare 4 half-pint jars, lids and bands. Wash tomatoes and dip in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds or until skins split. Dip in cold water, slip off skins, and remove cores. Coarsely chop tomatoes and combine chopped peppers, onions, and remaining ingredients in a large saucepan. Heat to boiling, and simmer 10 minutes. Fill jars, leaving ½ -inch headspace. Adjust lids and process in boiling water bath for 20 minutes.

Process in boiling water bath:

Put filled glass jars on rack in canner containing hot water. The jars should not touch the sides or bottom of pan, or each other. Add boiling water to bring water to 1 or 2 inches over tops of jars. Put cover on canner. When water in canner comes to a rolling boil, start to count processing time. Boil gently and steadily for the processing time recommended for the specific food (at least 11 minutes). Remove jars from the canner immediately when processing is finished.

Cool jars top side up on a rack or on a folded cloth. Give each jar enough room so that all sides are exposed to air. Never set a hot jar on a cold surface. Keep hot jars away from drafts, but don’t slow cooling by covering them.

Pressure canning

Prepare one-half pint of vegetable. Process each according to general pressure canning directions.

Prepare containers:

Prepare jars and lids as for water bath canning ten minutes or more (see page 68.)

Prepare food:

Raw Pack Carrots

Prepare one half-pint jar, lid and band. Wash, peel and rewash carrots. Slice or dice. Pack raw carrots tightly into clean jar, to 1 inch from top of jar. Fill jar with boiling water, leaving a 1-inch headspace. Adjust jar lids. Immediately process in pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure (116oC or 240oF) for 25 minutes.

Hot Pack Carrots

Prepare one half-pint jar, lid and band. Wash, peel and rewash carrots. Slice or dice. Cover with boiling water; bring to boil and simmer 5 minutes. Pack hot carrots to 1 inch from top. Cover with boiling hot cooking liquid, leaving 1-inch space at top of jar. Adjust jar lids. Immediately process in pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure (116oC or 240oF) for 25 minutes.

Note: For home canning, ⅛ tsp. salt may be added to the carrots for flavor before the jar is sealed. Salt has no role in preserving the wholesomeness or safety of canned vegetables.

Process in pressure canner:

Put 2 to 3 inches of boiling water in the bottom of canner. Space filled jars on rack in canner so that steam can flow around each jar. Fasten canner cover securely so that no steam can escape except through vent. Heat over high heat until steam pours steadily from vent; continue heating over high heat for 10 minutes or more to drive air from canner. Close petcock and/or set weight on vent post and allow pressure to rise to 10 pounds. For detailed instructions, follow manufacturer’s directions.

Start counting processing time when 10 pounds pressure (116oC or 240oF) is reached. Keep pressure constant by regulating heat under the canner. When processing time is up, remove canner from heat immediately. Let the canner depressurize at room temperature. NEVER cool the canner under cold running water or by opening petcock. When pressure registers zero, wait 1-2 minutes, then slowly open petcock or remove weight with tongs or fork tines. Unfasten cover and tilt the lid up so steam escapes away from you. Take jars from canner. Remove carefully as jars are not yet fully sealed. Place jars top side up on a towel or cooling rack, with air space between them. Never set a hot jar on a cold surface.

If liquid boiled out in processing, do not open jar to add more. Give each jar enough room to allow air to contact all sides. Keep hot jars away from drafts, but don’t slow cooling by covering them.

Following Laboratory Period

Remove bands of two-piece lids. Test the seal of lid. If lid has not sealed, reprocess by repeating the entire canning procedure, using a new lid; or refrigerate food and use within one or two days.

Wipe container clean and complete labeling if necessary. Wash bands and store for next use.

Store jars in dark, cool, dry place.

Evaluation Day

Check each jar of canned food before opening to ensure that it is still sealed.

If it is tightly sealed, remove the lid and inspect food for any change in appearance or odor that might be a sign of spoilage. If any spoilage is suspected, skip to step 4.

Vegetables: Do not taste any home- or laboratory-canned vegetables until they have been boiled at least 10 minutes. If any spoilage is suspected during cooking, do not taste the food. Commercially canned products should be safe without boiling. Fruits and Jelly: If no spoilage has been detected at steps 1 and 2, or when the food is removed from the jar, the food should be safe without further cooking.

If spoilage is suspected at any stage, check with your instructor for directions for safe disposal of food and container.

3.1 Concept Review Canning

6.4 Legumes

Objectives

To apply the principles of carbohydrate and protein cookery in rehydrating and cooking dried legumes.

To identify factors that influence the length of cooking time for dried legumes.

To prepare and taste several well-seasoned legume dishes which provide opportunities to gain increased appreciation of these economical and nutritious foods.

Laboratory Problems

Prepare legume dishes according to recipes provided. The recipe for ham broth used in several of these legume dishes is included below.

NOTE: Legumes must be soaked in advance in order to prepare and evaluate these recipes in a 3-hour laboratory period.

Terms

Gelatinization

General Directions For Preparing Legumes:

Prior to Lab:

Sort, then wash, dried legumes. One cup of dried legumes will yield approximately 2¼ cups after cooking.

Use soft water, if possible for soaking and cooking. Allow 2½ to 3 cups of water per cup of legumes. If very hard water must be used, add 1/8 tsp. baking soda per cup of beans.

Soaking Methods:

soaking legumes overnight in cold water, or

boiling legumes in water, uncovered, for 2 minutes then removing from heat, covering, and soaking for one hour.

During Lab:

Drain legumes, then cook in fresh water, or in broth according to specific recipe.

Season cooking water with ½ tsp. salt per cup of dried legumes.

Reduce foaming by adding 1 tbsp. fat per cup of legumes.

When using a pressure saucepan:

Fill only ⅓ full with water and always add 1 tbsp. fat to reduce foaming.

Cook under 15 lbs. pressure, beginning timing after pressure is reached.

Bring saucepan slowly to operating pressure and reduce pressure gradually (do not cool under running water.)

Continue preparation according to specific recipe.

6.4 Concept Review Legumes

Describe two appropriate ways of soaking dried legumes before cooking.

What ingredients were included in dried legume recipes to add complementary proteins?

When are salt and acid added in preparation of dried legumes?

What is the purpose of adding fat to the cooking water for dried legumes?

Why must legumes be soaked and/or pressure-cooked in preparation?

7 Deep Fat Frying

7.1 Deep Fat Frying

Objectives

To differentiate between oil and water as mediums of heat transfer.

To identify the qualities a food must possess to be successfully deep oil fried.

To determine the effect of various factors on the absorption of oil: Amounts and kinds of ingredients

Extent of manipulation of gluten products

Size and shape of food

Length of time food is in oil

Kind of oil and smoke point of oil

Terms

Smoke point–smoke begins to come off the surface of a hot oil

Flash point–small wisps of flame can be seen coming off the surface of hot oil

Fire point--too late–you do not want to go there

Rancidity–development of off flavors in oil as the oxidize and break down

Panko–Japanese-style bread crumbs resulting in very crisp texture

Fritter–deep fat fried food made with chopped foods and coated in batter

Croquette-mixture of meat and vegetables and mixed with white sauce and coated in batter then deep fat fried.

General Directions If the frying pan is heated on the range, put it on a back burner for safety. If an electric fryer is used, place it in safe position where no one can inadvertently catch the cord.

Keep lid close to fryer to extinguish fire in case the oil should flame. Do not cover pan unless the oil ignites.

Fill kettle only ⅓ to ½ full with oil.

Insert thermometer and heat oil to desired temperature.

Use a slotted spoon, tongs, or basket, depending on food, to transfer food into and out of oil. Do not crowd food. Make sure food is not more than one layer thick.

Hold food over oil to drain excess oil before transferring to paper towel.

Never leave heating oil unattended! (In case of fire, turn off burner and place lid on kettle to smother flame. Use wet towel, fire blanket, or fire extinguisher to smother other flames.) Do not use water to extinguish an oil fire.

Cool used oil, then pour through strainer lined with two or three thicknesses of cheesecloth.

9.1 Eggs - Quality and Cookery

Objectives

To apply principles of protein coagulation in egg cookery.

To determine the effects of various time-temperature treatments on the characteristics of coagulated egg proteins.

To identify characteristics of high quality egg products.

To identify signs of deterioration in stored eggs.

Laboratory Problems

Prepare fried eggs to determine the effect of the two standard methods of frying eggs on the characteristics of the products.

Prepare poached eggs, scrambled eggs, and a French omelet.

Prepare hard cooked eggs to determine the effect of temperature and time of cooking on eggs cooked in the shell.

Observe effects of storage at both refrigerator and room temperatures on fresh eggs.

Fried Eggs

1. Large amount of fat

Melt 1 tbsp. butter, bacon drippings, or other cooking fat in a heavy skillet. Carefully slip egg into pan. Cook slowly, basting (pour hot fat over the egg with a spoon) frequently, until done.

2. Small amount of fat

Melt 1 tsp. butter, bacon drippings, or other cooking fat in a heavy skillet. Slip egg carefully into pan. Add 1-2 tsp. water and cover. (Steam helps to coagulate the white over the yolk.) Cook over low heat until done, approximately 3 minutes.

Poached Eggs

Fill the bottom of a small saucepan with enough water to cover egg. Do not salt water. Heat to simmering. Break one egg into a custard cup and slip egg into the water. If poaching more than one egg, tip the dish so that the egg slides toward the edge of the pan rather than toward the center. Keep water hot but below simmering. Cook until white is evenly coagulated, approximately 3-5 minutes. Remove carefully with slotted spoon.

Characteristics of the Standard Product for a Fried Egg:

Egg itself is of high quality with thick, compact white and upstanding yolk.

Appearance Texture Flavor

Yolk centered, unbroken, covered with a film of coagulated egg white.

c. Repeat B, but at end of cooking period, leave egg in cooking water 10 additional minutes. Remove shell.

D. Bring egg to room temperature quickly by placing egg in hot tap water. Add warmed egg to boiling water and continue to boil for 30 minutes. Remove pan from heat, and leave egg in water 10 additional minutes. Remove shell.

Characteristics of a Standard Product for Eggs Cooked in Shell:

Appearance and texture Flavor

White firm yet tender.

Yolk mealy, evenly centered in white; no green ring.

Prepare Scrambled Eggs:

2 eggs 2 tbsp. liquid (water, milk, or tomato juice)

⅛ tsp. salt 1 tsp. butter or other cooking fat

Beat eggs with liquid and salt until blended but not foamy.

Top of range: Melt fat in a small, heavy skillet. Add egg mixture and cook slowly. As the egg begins to coagulate, lift and turn with a spatula until all of the egg is coagulated but still glossy. Allow sufficient coagulation in one place before turning so that the finished product contains large masses of soft egg rather than small pieces.

Microwave oven: Melt fat in microwave-ovenproof bowl; coat bowl with melted fat. Cook on high power for one minute, stir, continue to cook in 30 second increments stirring after each 30 seconds. Remove eggs from oven before they are completely coagulated to prevent overcooking. Let stand 1 to 3 minutes to complete cooking.

Prepare French Omelet:

2 eggs 2 tbsp. water

⅛ tsp. salt 1 tbsp. butter

Beat together eggs, water, and salt until well blended. In a non-stick omelet pan over medium-high heat, heat butter until just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water. Pour in egg mixture. Mixture should set immediately at the edges. With a rubber spatula, push cooked portions from the edges of the pan toward the center so uncooked portions can spill onto the hot pan surface. Tilt the pan as necessary, keeping the bottom covered with egg.

When the top is thickened and no visible liquid egg remains, fill one half of omelet with fillings. (Put filling on the left side if you’re right-handed and the right if you’re left-handed.) With spatula, fold omelet in half. Invert to serve – turn the pan upside down over the plate, and the omelet will land with its prettiest side up.

9.2 Eggs - Custard

Objectives

To determine the influence of sugar, dilution, amount of stirring, and rate of heating on the coagulation temperature of egg protein.

To demonstrate that stirring custards during coagulation results in a sol, and that baking a custard without stirring results in a gel.

To be able to use the standard procedure for preparing stirred and baked custards.

Procedures Baked and Stirred Custards – One recipe of the custard mix will be divided to make one baked custard and a stirred custard sauce from the same mix.

Preheat oven to 375ºF and Prepare Pans:

For the baked custard

Prepare water bath for the baked custard by putting a custard cup on a wire rack in a pan of very hot water. Water in pan should be nearly the same depth as custard in cup.

For the stirred custard

Prepare the double boiler by pouring only enough water into the lower pan of the double boiler so that the top pan will not touch the water. Bring the water to a boil, and then adjust the heat to maintain simmering temperature.

Custard Mix

2 cups milk ¼ cup sugar

2 or 3 eggs ⅛ tsp. salt

To speed preparation, heat milk to 75ºC. Break eggs into a custard cup one at a time. Remove chalazae with fork. Beat eggs in a medium or large bowl with a whisk or rotary beater just enough to blend yolk and white but not enough to form a foam. Add sugar and salt and blend. Stir in milk. Proceed to cook custard – baked or stirred custard sauce.

Baked Custard

Fill one custard cup with custard mix (approximately ½ cup mix). Add ⅛ tsp. vanilla. Set the custard in the water bath and bake until no custard sticks to a clean metal knife inserted ½ inch under the surface near the center of the cup. Minimum baking time is 1 hour for the 2-egg recipe and 50 minutes for the 3-egg recipe. When the custard tests done, remove it from the hot water and chill in ice water. Unmold the chilled custard onto a plate for serving.

Stirred Custard Sauce – crème anglaise

While that custard is baking, prepare the stirred custard sauce: Cook remaining custard mix in the top of the double boiler over simmering water, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula. When stirring, be careful to remove custard from sides of the pan. While the custard is cooking, chill a bowl in ice water. Continue cooking the sauce for approximately 10-15 minutes until the mixture forms a coating on a clean metal spoon (82-84ºC for the 2-egg recipe and 77-79ºC for the 3-egg recipe). Cook slowly. (Try the test on the uncooked sauce so that change in consistency can be recognized.) The thickness will be similar to a thin white sauce. Immediately pour the coagulated custard into the chilled bowl and blend in ¼ tsp. vanilla. Continue stirring until custard is cooled.

Characteristics of Standard Product for a Stirred Custard:

11.1 Dry Heat Methods - Roasting and Broiling

Objectives

To be able to identify cuts of meat appropriate for dry heat.

To be able to prepare and recognize three stages of doneness in dry heat meat cookery.

To determine the effect of the degree of doneness on flavor, juiciness, and tenderness of broiled and roasted tender cuts of meat.

Laboratory Problems

Identify cuts of meat to be prepared in this lab.

Roast pork rib roast.

Broil steaks to the four degrees of doneness.

Terms

Dry heat Roast

Pan-Fry

Pan-Broil

Oven broil–Beef Steaks

Deep-Fat Fry

Retail cuts Beef- Rib Steak, Club Steak, Porterhouse Steak, T-Bone Steak

Pork- Rib Chop, Loin Chop, Rib Roast

Lamb- Rib Chop, Loin Chop

Degree of doneness – check by color, texture Medium rare – 63oC (145oF)

Medium – 71oC (160oF)

Well done – 77oC (170oF)

Longissimus dorsi– Loin muscle

Psoas major– Tenderloin muscle

Myoglobin; Oxymyoglobin; Denatured Globin Hemichrome

Examine all cuts of meat before cooking, noting characteristics by which each can be identified:

Roast a pork rib roast

Set oven at 325°F.

Place meat, fat side up, in an open shallow roasting pan. The ribs replace the rack usually required for roasting. A boneless roast should be placed on a rack.

Insert a meat thermometer so that the bulb is in the center of the largest muscle. The bulb should not touch bone or rest in fat. If a glass thermometer is used, first pierce the meat with a metal skewer.

Roast to 63°C. (145°F).

Let stand approximately 10 minutes before carving.

Broil beef steaks to assigned degree of doneness:

°C °F Resting Time Interior Color

Medium-Rare 63 145 3 minutes Bright pink throughout interior

Medium 71 160 3 minutes Pink center, gray toward edges

Medium-Well 74 165 3 minutes Small amount of pink in center

Well Done 77 170 3 minutes Gray

Cut through fat and epimysium (connective tissue surrounding muscle) at approximately 1-inch intervals to prevent curling.

Remove broiler pan from oven; set the oven regulator for broiling. Preheat electric, but not gas, broilers.

Place meat on rack of broiler pan 2 to 5 inches from the heat. Steaks to be cooked rare should be closer to, and steaks to be well-done farther from, the heat sources.

Leave oven door open slightly while broiling

Broil until top side is brown. The meat should be approximately, or slightly more than, half-done by the time it is browned on top.

Do not season meat in laboratory. Outside the laboratory, broiled meats are seasoned after browning because salt tends to bring moisture to the cut surface and thus delays browning.

Turn and brown other side. Test for doneness by making a small cut along the bone, or in the center of a boneless cut, with a sharp knife. Use temperature as an additional indicator.

11.2 Dry Heat Methods of Meat Cookery for Tender and Tenderized Meat

Objectives

To identify cuts of meat

To observe the effect of mechanical tenderization on the tenderness of meat.

Laboratory Problems

Identify cuts of meat.

Panfry and panbroil lamb chops, beef patties, pork chops, pork sausage, and bacon.

Panfry mechanically tenderized steaks with and without flour coating.

Examine cuts of meat:

Panfry Instructions

Cut through epimysium (connective tissue surrounding muscle) at one-inch intervals.

Brown meat on both sides in a small amount of vegetable oil or shortening. For some cuts no additional fat needs to be added. For lean or breaded meat, use enough fat to cover the surface of the pan.

Turn meat occasionally to ensure even browning. Adjust heat so that meat is cooked to desired doneness without over- or under-browning surface.

To check doneness, make a small cut with a sharp knife along the bone, or in the center of a boneless cut.

Pan-broil Instructions

Cut through epimysium (connective tissue surrounding muscle) at one-inch intervals.

Brush pan surface with vegetable oil or shortening to prevent sticking. (Omit this step if the pan you use has a non-stick surface.)

Place meat in heavy frying pan or on a griddle.

Cook slowly, turning occasionally. Adjust heat so that meat is cooked to desired doneness without over- or under-browning of surface.

Pour off fat is it accumulates so that meat is not fried.

Test for doneness by making a small cut with a sharp knife close to the bone, or in the center of a boneless cut.

Panfry Mechanically Tenderized Steaks

Minute Steaks

2 minute steaks (mechanically tenderized and flattened beef), ¼ lb. each

1-2 tsp. oil ¼ cup flour

½ tsp. salt dash pepper

Without flour: Add oil to skillet. Add steaks. Panfry until just well done, approximately 2 minutes on each side. Season with salt and pepper.

Floured: Melt fat in skillet. Mix flour, salt and pepper. Dredge meat in flour mixture and panfry until coating is brown and meat is well done, approximately 2 minutes on each side.

Prepare Enzyme Tenderized Steak using Round Steaks

12.7 Interaction of Ingredients

Objectives

To compare characteristics of cakes made by different methods.

To compare effects of various leavening systems on cake volume and texture.

To determine the roles and interactions of ingredients in cakes.

Laboratory Problems

Prepare quick-mix yellow cake.

Prepare pound cake.

Compare characteristics of quick-mix, conventional method (p. 213), and pound cakes.

Quick Mix Yellow Cake

½ cup sifted cake flour ¼ cup milk

⅓ cup sugar ½ egg (2 tbsp.)

¾ tsp. baking powder ¼ tsp. vanilla

2 tbsp. vegetable shortening ¼ tsp. salt

Heat oven to 375°F. Line bottom of 6 X 3¼-inch loaf pan with waxed paper. Grease the paper. Measure cake flour, sugar, baking powder, shortening, salt and half the milk into mixer bowl. Mix thoroughly for 2½ minutes with electric mixer on medium speed. Add remaining milk, egg, and vanilla; mix for 3 minutes on medium speed. Bake at 375°F until cake springs back when touched lightly, about 25-30 minutes. Cool 10 minutes on rack; remove from pan. Do not cut cake until cake has cooled to room temperature.

Pound Cake

1 cup sifted all-purpose flour ½ cup butter, room temperature

¼ tsp. salt ½ tsp. vanilla

⅔ cup sugar 2 eggs

Heat oven to 350°F. Line bottom of 7⅜ X 3⅝-inch loaf pan with waxed paper. Grease the paper. Sift together flour and salt. Cream butter and vanilla with electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add sugar by tablespoons while beating. Beat until sugar is fairly well dissolved and mixture is light. Beat eggs with electric mixer until foamy. Add eggs in thirds, beating about 1 minute after each addition. Gradually add flour to creamed mixture, beating continually. After all flour is added, beat for 2 minutes on medium speed. Pour into prepared pan. Bake at 350°F for 20 min.; reduce heat to 325°F and continue baking for 25 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean. Cool 10-15 minutes before removing from pan. Do not cut cake until cake has cooled to room temperature.

Interaction of Ingredients in Batters and Doughs

Shortened cakes and other similar products based on gluten structure may vary from high to low fat ratio. The correct proportion of one ingredient is dependent on the proportion of other ingredients and on the amount of manipulation. The following general rules account for the differences in formula for muffins, conventional and quick mix cakes, etc.

Balance structural with tenderizing ingredients.

Structural Tenderizing

flour fat

eggs sugar

Flour/liquid ratios and manipulation also influence structure.

Balance liquid and dry ingredients.

Liquid Dry

milk flour

egg sugar

water

This is necessary to control gluten potential, maintain optimum flow properties, provide liquid for steam, etc.

Balance sugar and liquid. As sugar/liquid ratio increases, protein coagulation temperature rises and allows more expansion before the gluten is coagulated. Optimum sugar/liquid ratios allow expansion for optimum volume and tenderness. Beyond that, the cake may run over the top of the pan, burn, or collapse. Increased sugar requires both increased liquid and increased structural components. Egg provides both.

Balance leavenings. As one leavening is increased, another may be decreased. Leavening agents include baking powder, baking soda and acid, steam, air in foams (egg, creamed fat and sugar), and yeast.

As proportions of flour and liquid approach 2:1, manipulation yields more gluten, and the amount of manipulation is more critical.

As the proportion of tenderizing ingredients increase, beating should be increased, and the grain becomes finer.

12.10 Yeast Rolls Concept Review

 List and describe the function of each of the ingredients in the yeast loaf bread recipe:

Ingredients Function

Fill in the following terms related to bread:

Food for yeast: ________ (yeast breaks sucrose down into glucose and fructose)

Ideal temperature for yeast fermentation: ______________, (yeast cells die at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or greater)

__________________

Also known as bread machine yeast, comprised of more active yeast strains and may also contain enzymes and other additives to shorten the rising and proofing times by half.

____________________

Adding water to active dry yeast to “wake them up” for proper yeast fermentation.

____________________

Heating the milk to 180○F before used in bread making. If this step is skipped, the dough is slack and sticky and the bread is coarse and has low volume.

Flour to liquid ratio in yeast bread? _______________

___________________

Manipulation of bread dough for proper gluten formation in bread dough, generally done by pressing and folding of dough until a smooth, not sticky dough is formed.

_________________________

Steps include hydration, first rise, shaping and second rise or proof

________________________

Large increase in volume of bread dough when placed in the oven caused by rapid yeast fermentation as the temperature increases in the oven. After the oven spring occurs, the fermentation stops and the yeast is dead.

Appendix D - Glossary of Cooking Terms

 -A-

Aerate – To pass dry ingredients through a fine-mesh sifter so large pieces can be removed. The process also incorporates air to make ingredients like flour, lighter. Sifting dry ingredients aerates them while distributing small amounts of chemical leaveners or dry seasoning evenly through the mixture. Use sifters, sieves or tamis to both aerate and sift.

Al dente – Italian for “to the tooth.” It describes pasta that is cooked until it offers a slight resistance when bitten into, rather than cooked until soft.

-B-

Bake – To cook food, covered or uncovered, using the direct, dry heat of an oven. The term is usually used to describe the cooking of cakes, other desserts, casseroles, and breads.

Bard – To tie fat around lean meats or fowl to keep them from drying out during roasting. The fat bastes the meat while it cooks, keeping it moist and adding flavor. The fat is removed a few minutes before the meat is finished, allowing the meat to brown. Barding is necessary only when there is no natural fat present.

Baste – To brush or spoon food as it cooks with melted fat or the cooking juices from the dish. Basting prevents foods from drying out and adds color and flavor. That’s because basting tools, such as brushes and bulb basters, could be sources of bacteria if contaminated when dipped into uncooked or undercooked meat and poultry juices, then allowed to sit at room temperature and used later for basting.

Batter – An uncooked, wet mixture that can be spooned or poured, as with cakes, pancakes, and muffins. Batters usually contain flour, eggs, and milk as their base. Some thin batters are used to coat foods before deep frying.

Beat – To make a mixture smooth by briskly whipping or stirring it with a spoon, fork, wire whisk, rotary beater, or electric mixer.

Bias-slice – To slice a food crosswise at a 45-degree angle.

Blackened – A popular Cajun cooking method in which seasoned fish or other foods are cooked over high heat in a super-heated heavy skillet until charred, resulting in a crisp, spicy crust. At home, this is best done outdoors because of the large amount of smoke produced.

Blanch – To cook raw ingredients in boiling water briefly. Blanched vegetables are generally “shocked” i.e. plunged immediately and briefly into an ice water bath to stop the cooking process and preserve color and crunch.

Blend – To combine two or more ingredients together with a spoon, beater or blender.

Broil – To heat a liquid to its boiling point, until bubbles break the surface. “Boil” also means to cook food in a boiling liquid.

Bone – To remove the bones from meat, fish or fowl. Use a sharp boning knife and angle the blade toward the bone to avoid tearing or nicking the flesh.

Braise – To cook food, tightly covered, in a small amount of liquid at low heat for a long period of time. Sometimes, the food is first browned in fat. The long, slow cooking tenderizes meats by gently breaking down their fibers. The braising liquid keeps meats moist and can be used as a basis for sauce. Use wine, stocks or water as components in braising liquid.

Brine – Heavily salted water used to pickle or cure vegetables, meats, fish, and seafood.

Broil – To cook food a measured distance below direct, dry heat. When broiling, position the broiler pan and its rack so that the surface of the food (not the rack) is the specified distance from the heat source. Use a ruler to measure this distance.

Broth – The strained clear liquid in which meat, poultry, or fish has been simmered with vegetables and herbs. It is similar to stock and can be used interchangeably with it. Reconstituted bouillon can also be used when broth is specified.

Brown – To cook a food in a skillet, broiler, or oven to add flavor and aroma and develop a rich, desirable color on the outside and moistness on the inside.

Brush – To apply a liquid, like a glaze, to the surface of food using a pastry brush.

Butterfly – To split food (meat, fish, fowl) down the center, cutting almost, but not completely through. The two halves are then opened flat to resemble a butterfly.

-C-

Canel – To create small V-shaped grooves over the surface of fruits or vegetables for decorative purposes using a canelle knife. The fruit or vegetable is then sliced, creating a decorative border on the slices.

Caramelize – To heat sugar until it liquefies and become a clear caramel syrup ranging in color from golden to dark brown. Fruits and vegetables with natural sugars can be caramelized by sautéing, roasting or grilling, giving them a sweet flavor and golden glaze.

Carve – To cut or slice cooked meat, poultry, fish, or game into serving-size pieces.

Chiffonade – To slice into very thin strips or shreds. Literally translated from French, the term means “made of rags”. Often used on fresh herbs or lettuce.

Chill – To cool food to below room temperature in the refrigerator or over ice. When recipes call for chilling foods, it should be done in the refrigerator.

Chop – To cut food into bite-size pieces using a knife. A food processor may also be used to chop food. Chopped food is more coarsely cut than minced food.

Clarify – To remove sediment from a cloudy liquid, thereby making it clear. To clarify liquids, such as stock, egg whites and/or eggshells are commonly added and simmered for approximately 15 minutes. The egg whites attract and trap particles from the liquid. After cooling, strain the mixture through a cloth-lined sieve to remove residue. To clarify rendered fat, add hot water and boil for about 15 minutes. The mixture should then be strained through several layers of cheesecloth and chilled. The resulting layer of fat should be completely clear of residue. Clarified butter is butter that has been heated slowly so that its milk solids separate and sink, and can be discarded. The resulting clear liquid can be used at a higher cooking temperature and will not go rancid as quickly as unclarified butter.

Cream – To beat a fat, such as butter or shortening either alone or with sugar, to a light, fluffy consistency. May be done by hand with a wooden spoon or with an electric mixer. This process incorporates air into the fat so baked products have a lighter texture and a better volume.

Crimp – To pinch or press pastry or dough together using your fingers, a fork, or another utensil. Usually done for a piecrust edge.

Crisp-tender – A term that describes the state of vegetables that have been cooked until just tender but still somewhat crunchy. At this stage, a fork can be inserted with a little pressure.

Curdle – To cause semisolid pieces of coagulated protein to develop in a dairy product. This can occur when foods such as milk or sour cream are heated to too high a temperature or are combined with an acidic food, such as lemon juice or tomatoes.

Cure – To treat food by one of several methods for preservation purposes. Examples are smoking, pickling – in an acid base, corning – with acid and salt, and salt curing – which removes water.

Cut-in – To work a solid fat, such as shortening, butter, or margarine, into dry ingredients. This is usually done with a pastry blender, two knives in a crisscross fashion, your fingertips, or a food processor.

-D-

Dash – Refers to a small amount of seasoning that is added to food. It is generally between 1/16 and 1/8 teaspoon. The term is often used for liquid ingredients, such as bottled hot pepper sauce.

Deep-fry – To cook food in hot fat or oil deep enough so that it is completely covered. The temperature of the fat is extremely important and can make the difference between success and failure. When the fat is not hot enough, the food absorbs fat and becomes greasy. When the fat is too hot, the food burns on the exterior before it has cooked through. Fat at the correct temperature will produce food with a crisp, dry exterior and moist interior. An average fat temperature for deep-frying is 375 degrees, but the temperature varies according to the food being fried. Use a deep fryer, an electric fry pan or a heavy pot and a good kitchen thermometer for deep-frying.

Deglaze – To remove browned bits of food from the bottom of a pan after sautéing, usually meat. After the food and excess fat have been removed from the pan, a small amount of liquid is heated with the cooking juices in the pan and stirred to remove browned bits of food from the bottom. The resulting mixture often becomes the base for a sauce.

Devein – To remove the blackish-gray vein from the back of a shrimp. The vein can be removed with a special utensil called a deveiner or with the tip of a sharp knife. Small and medium shrimp need deveining for aesthetic purposes only. However, because the veins in large shrimp contain grit, they should always be removed.

Dice – To cut food into tiny cubes (about 1/8- to 1/4-inch).

Double Broiler – A two-pan arrangement where one pan nests partway inside the other. The lower pot holds simmering water that gently cooks heat-sensitive food in the upper pot.

Drain – To pour off fat or liquid from food, often using a colander.

Dredge – To lightly coat food that is going to be fried with flour, breadcrumbs or cornmeal. The coating helps to brown the food and provides a crunchy surface. Dredged foods need to be cooked immediately, while breaded foods, those dredged in flour, dipped in egg then dredged again in breading, can be prepared and held before cooking.

Drizzle – To randomly pour a liquid, such as powdered sugar icing, in a thin stream over food.

-E-

Emulsify – To bind together two liquid ingredients that normally do not combine smoothly, such as water and fat. Slowly add one ingredient to the other while mixing rapidly. This action disperses tiny droplets of one liquid in the other. Mayonnaise and vinaigrettes are emulsions. Use a good whisk for steady, even emulsification.

Extracts, Oils – Products based on the aromatic essential oils of plant materials that are distilled by various means. In extracts, the highly concentrated oils are usually suspended in alcohol to make them easier to combine with other foods in cooking and baking. Almond, anise, lemon, mint, orange, peppermint, and vanilla are some commonly available extracts.

Some undiluted oils are also available, usually at pharmacies. These include oil of anise, oil of cinnamon, oil of cloves, oil of peppermint, and oil of wintergreen. Do not try to substitute oils for ground spices in recipes. Oils are so concentrated that they’re measured in drops, not teaspoons. Oil of cinnamon, for example, is 50 times stronger than ground cinnamon. You can, however, substitute 1 or 2 drops of an oil for 1/2 teaspoon extract in frosting or candy recipes.

-F-

Fillet – verb – To create a fillet of fish or meat by cutting away the bones. Fish and boning knives help produce clean fillets.

Noun – A piece of meat or fish that has no bones.

Flake – To gently break food into small, flat pieces

Flour (verb) – To coat or dust a food or utensil with flour. Food may be floured before cooking to add texture and improve browning. Baking utensils sometimes are floured to prevent sticking.

Flute – To make a decorative impression in food, usually a piecrust.

Fold – To combine a light mixture like beaten egg whites with a much heavier mixture like whipped cream. In a large bowl, place the lighter mixture on top of the heavier one. Starting at the back of the bowl, using the edge of a rubber spatula, cut down through the middle of both mixtures, across the bottom of the bowl and up the near side. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and repeat. This process gently combines the two mixtures.

Fry – To cook food (non-submerged) in hot fat or oil over moderate to high heat. There is very little difference between frying and sautéing although sautéing is often thought of as being faster and using less fat.

-G-

Grate – To reduce a large piece of food to coarse or fine threads by rubbing it against a rough, serrated surface, usually on a grater. A food processor, fitted with the appropriate blades, can also be used for grating. The food that is being grated should be firm. Cheese that needs to be grated can be refrigerated first for easier grating.

Grease – To coat a utensil, such as a baking pan or skillet, with a thin layer of fat or oil. A pastry brush works well to grease pans. Also refers to fat released from meat and poultry during cooking.

Grill – To cook food on a grill over hot coals or other heat source. The intense heat creates a crust on the surface of the food which seals in the juices. The grill should be clean and must be heated before the food is laid on it. The food can also be basted and seasoned.

Grind – To reduce food to small pieces by running it through a grinder. Food can be ground to different degrees, from fine to coarse.

-H-

Homogenize – To create an emulsion by reducing all the particles to the same size. The fat globules are broken down mechanically until they are evenly distributed throughout the liquid. Homogenized milk and some commercial salad dressings are two examples of homogenized foods.

-I-

Infuse – To steep an aromatic ingredient in hot liquid until the flavor has been extracted and absorbed by the liquid. Teas are infusions. Milk or cream can also be infused with flavor before being used in custards or sauces.

-J-

Joint – To cut meat and poultry into large pieces at the joints using a very sharp knife.

Julienne – To cut food into thin sticks. Food is cut with a knife or mandoline into even slices, then into strips.

-K-

Knead – To mix and work dough into a smooth, elastic mass. Kneading can be done either manually or by machine. By hand, kneading is done with a pressing-folding-turning action. First the dough is pressed with the heels of both hands and pushed away from the body so the dough stretches out. The dough is then folded in half, given a quarter turn, and the process is repeated. Depending on the dough, the kneading time can range anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. During kneading, the gluten strands stretch and expand, enabling dough to hold in gas bubbles formed by a leavener, which allows it to rise.

-L-

Lard – To insert strips of fat (lardons) or bacon into a dry cut of meat using a utensil called a larding needle. Larding makes the cooked meat more succulent and tender.

Line – To cover the bottom and sides of a cassoulet, mold or terrine with a thin layer of bacon, pork fat, flavorings or pastry. Cake pans are frequently lined with parchment paper to prevent the cake from sticking to the pan after baking.

-M-

Macerate – To soak foods, usually fruit, in liquid so they absorb the liquid’s flavor. The macerating liquid is usually alcohol, liqueur, wine, brandy or sugar syrup. Macerate is also frequently applied to fruits sprinkled with sugar, which intensifies natural flavor of the fruit by drawing out its juices.

Marble – To gently swirl one food into another. Marbling is usually done with light and dark batters for cakes or cookies.

Marinate – To soak food in a seasoned liquid mixture for a certain length of time. The purpose of marinating is to add flavor and/or tenderize the food. Due to the acidic ingredients in many marinades, foods should be marinated in glass, ceramic or stainless steel containers. Foods should also be covered and refrigerated while they are marinating. When fruits are soaked in this same manner, the process is called macerating.

Mash – To crush a food into smooth and evenly textured state. For potatoes or other root vegetables, use a ricer, masher or food mill. While food processors provide a smooth texture more like a puree or a paste, they should not be used for potatoes.

Mince – To cut food into very tiny pieces. Minced food is cut into smaller, finer pieces than diced food.

Mirepoix – A seasoning composed of finely diced sautéed vegetables and herbs and sometimes diced ham, bacon, or salt pork.

Mix – To stir or beat two or more foods together until they are thoroughly combined. May be done with an electric mixer, a rotary beater, or by hand with a wooden spoon.

Moisten – To add enough liquid to a dry ingredient or mixture to make it damp but not runny.

Mount – To whisk cold butter, piece by piece, into a warm sauce for smooth texture, flavor and sheen. Each piece of butter must be thoroughly incorporated before a new piece is added so that the sauce does not break (or separate into liquid and fat).

Mull – To slowly heat a beverage, such as cider, with spices and sugar.

-N-

Nap – To completely coat food with a light, thin, even layer of sauce.

-O-

Open Faced – A sandwich prepared with just one piece of bread which is topped with a wide variety of meats, vegetables, cheeses and heated or not.

-P-

Pan-broil- To cook a food, especially meat, in a skillet without added fat, removing any fat as it accumulates.

Parboil – To boil food briefly in water, cooking it only partially. Parboiling is used for dense food like carrots and potatoes. After being parboiled, these foods can be added at the last minute to quicker-cooking ingredients. Parboiling ensures that all ingredients will finish cooking at the same time. Since foods will continue to cook once they have been removed from the boiling water, they should be shocked in ice water briefly to preserve color and texture. Cooking can then be completed by sautéing or the parboiled vegetable can be added to simmering soups or stews.

Pare – To remove the thin outer layer of foods using a paring knife or a vegetable peeler.

Peel – To remove the rind or skin from a fruit or vegetable using a knife or vegetable peeler.

Pinch – A small amount of a dry ingredient (the amount that can be pinched between a finger and the thumb).

Poach – To cook food by gently simmering in liquid at or just below the boiling point. The amount of the liquid and poaching temperature depends on the food being poached.

Pot Roast – To cook meat slowly by moist heat in a covered pot. The meat is first browned, then braised either on top of the stove or in the oven. Pot roasting is good for tougher cuts of meat which require longer cooking times to break down connective tissue.

Pound – Pounding thinner cuts of meat tenderizes it by breaking down muscle. Kitchen mallets are generally used for pounding, but it can be done using a small frying pan as well. First place the piece of meat between two pieces of plastic wrap or wax paper.

Preheat – To heat an oven or a utensil to a specific temperature before using it.

Process – To preserve food at home by canning, or to prepare food in a food processor.

Purée – To grind or mash food until completely smooth. This can be done using a food processor or blender or by pressing the food through a sieve.

-Q-

Quadriller – To mark the surface of grilled or broiled food with a crisscross pattern of lines. The scorings are produced by contact with very hot single grill bars which brown the surface of the food. Very hot skewers may also be used to mark the surface.

Quench – To quickly place a heated object in cold water. This is usually done to either stop the cooking process or to separate the skin of an object from the meat. This process is sometimes referred to as “shocking.”

-R-

Reconstitute – To bring a concentrated or condensed food, such as frozen fruit juice, to its original strength by adding water.

Reduce – To decrease the volume of a liquid by boiling it rapidly to cause evaporation. As the liquid evaporates, it thickens and intensifies in flavor. The resulting richly flavored liquid, called a reduction, can be used as a sauce or as the base of a sauce. When reducing liquids, use the pan size specified in the recipe, as the surface area of the pan affects how quickly the liquid will evaporate.

Rice – To push cooked food through a perforated kitchen tool called a ricer. The resulting food looks like rice.

Roast – To oven-cook food in an uncovered pan. The food is exposed to high heat which produces a well-browned surface and seals in the juices. Reasonably tender pieces of meat or poultry should be used for roasting. Food that is going to be roasted for a long time may be barded to prevent drying out.

Roux (roo)- A French term that refers to a mixture of flour and a fat cooked to a golden- or rich-brown color and used for a thickening in sauces, soups, and gumbos.

-S-

Sauté – To cook food quickly in a small amount of fat or oil, until brown, in a skillet or sauté pan over direct heat. The sauté pan and fat must be hot before the food is added, otherwise the food will absorb oil and become soggy.

Scald – To dip fruits or vegetables in boiling water in order to loosen their skins and simplify peeling. The produce should be left in the water for only 30 seconds to prohibit cooking, and should be shocked in an ice water bath before the skin is removed

Scale – To remove the scales from the skin of a fish using a dull knife or a special kitchen tool called a fish scaler.

Score – To cut narrow slits, often in a diamond pattern, through the outer surface of a food to decorate it, tenderize it, help it absorb flavor, or allow fat to drain as it cooks.

Sear – To brown meat or fish quickly over very high heat either in a fry pan, under a broiler or in a hot oven. Searing seals in the food’s juices and provides a crisp tasty exterior. Seared food can then be eaten rare or roasted or braised to desired degree of doneness.

Season – To add flavor to foods. To coat the cooking surface of a new pot or pan with vegetable oil then heat in a 350 degree oven for about an hour. This smoothes out the surface of new pots and pans, particularly cast-iron, and prevents foods from sticking.

Section – To separate and remove the membrane of segments of citrus fruits. To section oranges, use a paring knife to remove the peel and white rind. Working over a bowl to catch the juice, cut between one orange section and the membrane, slicing to the center of the fruit. Turn the knife and slide it up the other side of the section along the membrane, cutting outward. Repeat with remaining sections.

Seed – To remove the seeds from fruits and vegetables.

Shred – To cut food into thin strips. This can be done by hand or by using a grater or food processor. Cooked meat can be shredded by pulling it apart with two forks.

Shuck – To remove the shells from seafood, such as oysters and clams, or the husks from corn.

Sieve – To strain liquids or particles of food through a sieve or strainer. Press the solids, using a ladle or wooden spoon, into the strainer to remove as much liquid and flavor as possible.

Sift – To pass dry ingredients through a fine mesh sifter so large pieces can be removed. The process also incorporates air to make ingredients like flour, lighter. Synonymous with AERATE.

Simmer – To cook food in liquid over gentle heat, just below the boiling point, low enough so that tiny bubbles just begin to break the surface.

Skewer – To spear small pieces of food on long, thin, pointed rods called skewers.

Skim – To remove the scum that rises to the surface from a liquid when it is boiled. The top layer of the liquid, such as the cream from milk or the foam and fat from stock, soups or sauces, can be removed using a spoon, ladle or skimmer. Soups, stews or sauces can be chilled so that the fat coagulates on the surface and may be easily removed before reheating.

Skin – To remove the skin from food before or after cooking. Poultry, fish and game are often skinned for reasons of appearance, taste and diet.

Slice – A flat, usually thin, piece of food cut from a larger piece. Also the process of cutting flat, thin pieces

Snip – To cut food, often fresh herbs or dried fruit, with kitchen shears or scissors into very small, uniform pieces using short, quick strokes.

Smoke – To expose fresh food to smoke from a wood fire for a prolonged period of time. Traditionally used for preservation purposes, smoking is now a means of giving flavor to food. Smoking tends to dry the food, kills bacteria, deepens color and gives food a smoky flavor. The duration of smoking varies from 20 minutes to several days. The most commonly used woods are beech, oak and chestnut to which aromatic essences are often added. Small home smokers are now available.

Springform Pan – A round pan with high sides and a removable bottom. The bottom is removed by releasing a spring that holds the sides tight around it. This makes it easy to remove food from the pan.

Steam – Steaming retains flavor, shape, texture, and nutrients better than boiling or poaching.

Steep – To allow a food, such as tea, to stand in water that is just below the boiling point in order to extract flavor or color.

Stew – To cook food in liquid for a long time until tender, usually in a covered pot. The term also refers to a mixture prepared this way.

Stir – To mix ingredients with a spoon or other utensil to combine them, to prevent ingredients from sticking during cooking, or to cool them after cooking.

Stir-fry – A method of quickly cooking small pieces of food in a little hot oil in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat while stirring constantly.

Stock – The strained clear liquid in which meat, poultry, or fish has been simmered with vegetables or herbs. It is similar to broth but is richer and more concentrated. Stock and broth can be used interchangeably; reconstituted bouillon can also be substituted for stock.

Supreme – To remove the flesh sections of citrus fruit from the membranes. Using a sharp knife, cut away all of the skin and pith from the outside of the fruit. Place the knife between the membrane and the flesh of one section and slice down. Turn the knife catching the middle of the fruit. Slice up, removing each section sans membrane.

Sweat – To cook vegetables in fat over gentle heat so they become soft but not brown, and their juices are concentrated in the cooking fat. If the pan is covered during cooking, the ingredients will keep a certain amount of their natural moisture. If the pan is not covered, the ingredients will remain relatively dry.

-T-

Temper – 1. To slowly bring up the temperature of a cold or room temperature ingredient by adding small amounts of a hot or boiling liquid. Adding the hot liquid gradually prevents the cool ingredient, such as eggs, from cooking or setting. The tempered mixture can then be added back to hot liquid for further cooking. This process is used most in making pastry cream and the like. 2. To bring chocolate to a state in which it has snap, shine and no streaks. Commercially available chocolate is already tempered but this condition changes when it is melted. Tempering is often done when the chocolate will be used for candy making or decorations. Chocolate must be tempered because it contains cocoa butter, a fat that forms crystals after chocolate is melted and cooled. Dull grey streaks form and are called bloom. The classic tempering method is to melt chocolate until it is totally without lumps (semisweet chocolate melts at a temperature of 104 degrees F.) One third of the chocolate is then poured onto a marble slab then spread and worked back and forth with a metal spatula until it becomes thick and reaches a temperature of about 80 degrees F. The thickened chocolate is then added back to the remaining 2/3 melted chocolate and stirred. The process is repeated until the entire mixture reaches 88-92 degrees for semisweet chocolate, 84-87 degrees for milk or white chocolate.

Tenderize – To make meat more tender by pounding with a mallet, marinating for varying periods of time, or storing at lower temperatures. Fat may also be placed into a piece of meat to make it more tender during cooking.

Toast – The process of browning, crisping, or drying a food by exposing it to heat. Toasting coconut, nuts, and seeds helps develop their flavor. Also the process of exposing bread to heat so it becomes browner, crisper, and drier.

Toss – To mix ingredients lightly by lifting and dropping them using two utensils.

Truss – To secure food, usually poultry or game, with string, pins or skewers so that it maintains a compact shape during cooking. Trussing allows for easier basting during cooking.

-U-

Unleavened – Any baked good that has no leavener, such as yeast, baking powder or baking soda.

-V-

Vandyke – To cut zigzags in edges of fruit and vegetables halves, usually oranges, tomatoes or lemons. The food is usually used as a garnish to decorate a dish.

-W-

Weeping – When liquid separates out of a solid food, such as jellies, custards, and meringues.

Whip – To beat ingredients such as egg whites or cream until light and fluffy. Air is incorporated into the ingredients as they are whipped, increasing their volume until they are light and fluffy.

Whisk – To beat ingredients together until smooth, using a kitchen tool called a whisk.

-X-

XXX, XXXX, 10X – An indicator on a box of confectioners’ sugar of how many times it has been ground. The higher the number of X’s the finer the grind.

-Y-

Yakitori – A Japanese term meaning “grilled.”

-Z-

Zest – To remove the outermost skin layers of citrus fruit using a knife, peeler or zester. When zesting, be careful not to remove the pith, the white layer between the zest and the flesh, which is bitter.
